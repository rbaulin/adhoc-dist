Simple ad-hoc distribution with gh-pages.
Powered by fastlane.

*Considerations*

- No need in normalize.css etc since mobile safari is a modern browser
- All in one html to reduce number of files and sort of clean
- Inline templating to avoid template engines

As a bonus you can resign expired ipas of other developers (please do not upload them to app store)

*Git LFS*

Unfortunatelly git lfs breaks adhoc manifest and distribution does not work :(
